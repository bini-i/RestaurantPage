This project is a rails app where articles with a theme of wild animals and wildlife are grouped under different categories and an authenticated user has an option to create, view, edit and delete articles:

As a guest user:
- Create an account/log in
- See Home page and category page 

As a logged-in user:
- Create articles.
- Upvote articles.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful is listed in the acknowledgements.
